    Our robots are going to put illuminated lanterns on a river and look how they are floated.
    Rivers in the RoboLand have flat banks, right angle turns and the same width on the whole flowing.
</p>

<p>
    Robot put all lanterns in one row for the whole width of the river simultaneously.
    Each lantern float with constant speed - 1 cell/minute.
    A river has several streams and each lantern will float in own stream which are not intersected.
    The image below describes how streams are routed.

</p>

<p>
    The river flow from north to south edge. It's not intersected or merged with other river or itself.
    Because the river has the same width streams are not intersected each other.
</p>

<p>
    Robots place lanterns on the north edge of river. This is 0th minutes.
    The number of lanterns is equal to the river width in cells.
    Each lantern light all neighbours water cells (including diagonals cells).
    You should model lantern flow and say how many water cells will be lightened in X minute.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a map of river fragment as a sequence of strings which forms a matrix.
    Water cells are marked as ".", land cells - "X".
    And you are given a time as a number of minutes from the start.
    Count how many water cells will be lightened.
    If a cell is lightened twice then count it once.
    And don't forget count cells with lanterns.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A map of river as a tuple of strings and time as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of lightened water cells as an integer.
